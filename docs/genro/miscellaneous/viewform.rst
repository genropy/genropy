=====================
view and data windows
=====================
    
    *Last page update*: |today|
    
    Usually the GUI management of a form is made by two sections:
    
    * the :ref:`genro_data_entry`
    * the :ref:`genro_view_data`
    
    These two windows can live in a single :ref:`webpages_webpages`, or in two
    :ref:`stackContainers <genro_stackcontainer>`, or one in a page and one in a
    dialog, and so on.
    
    There is a :ref:`genro_component` that allows to handle the creation and the
    disposition of these two windows: the :ref:`genro_th`.
