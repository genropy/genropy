.. _datastore_description:

Description
===========

	The datastore is a Genro :ref:`genro_bag_intro` used to keep track of data.

	Through various python commands, you can attach the javascript code to the events of the components interface or events generated by the datastore.

.. _datastore_syntax:

Datastore syntax
================

	The path followed by the syntax in the datastore:

	* ``path.absolute.in.datastore``
	* ``.path.relative.in.datastore``
	* ``#ID.path.relative.to.the.ID``

	The path indicates the access path to data to every element of the datastore (it is implemented by reading the Bag interface, and thus includes many things: for example, you can also specify the CSS classes of an HTML element linking them to an element of the datastore), using the prefixes:

	* "^" (circumflex accent): ``^access.to.resolver``, setting an observer at this node. The component will be informed of changes to the datastore
	* equal: ``=accessed.from.resolver``, reads the contents of the datastore.

.. _datastore_access:

Access to the datastore from javascript
=======================================

	The possible operations on the datastore include some macros, that are:
	
	* :ref:`genro_set`
	* :ref:`genro_put`
	* :ref:`genro_get`
	* :ref:`genro_fire`
	
	They can be specified in the javascript events associated with an interface, and the framework deals gnrjs to the expansion of these macros. Check the :ref:`genro_macro` page for further details.

.. _datastore_debugger:

The datastore graphical interface
=================================

	You can access to its graphic interface from any Genro webpage by clicking ``ctrl+shift+D`` [#]_:
