    There are a lot of components in Genro. They provide you different solutions to simplify your work.
    In this page we list ALL of them with a short description, in order to help you in the search of
    the right component for your task (and if you don't find it, you can always create your own one,
    following the walkthrough of the :ref:`components_writing` page)
    
    They are divided in the following categories:
