    There are a lot of components in Genro. They provide you different solutions to simplify your work.
    In this page we list ALL of them with a short description, in order to help you in the search of
    the right component for your task (and if you don't find it, you can always create your own one,
    following the walkthrough of the :ref:`components_writing` page)
    
    **Dialogs**:
    
    * iframedialog
    * simpledialog
    
    **Index pages**: management of the index page of your project
    
    * :ref:`frameindex`: it allows to handle your :ref:`webpages_webpages` as iframes of the main
      page (for more information on the login page, check the :ref:`methods_loginUrl` section)
      
    **View/Form handler**: a preconceived interface with a View class for the view of the inserted
    records and a Form class for the records insertion.
    
    * :ref:`includedview`: **deprecated** since version *0.7* and replaced by the :ref:`th`
    * the :ref:`th`: add???
    
      This component is structured in many components:
      
      * :ref:`th_border`: show the View class and the Form class in a single page
      * :ref:`th_dialog`: show the Form class as a dialog of the page with the View class
      * :ref:`th_page`: show the View class and the Form class in two separated frames
      * :ref:`th_palette`: show the Form class as a palette of the page with the View class
      * :ref:`th_plain`: show only the View class page
      * :ref:`th_stack`: show the View class and the Form class in two separated pages
