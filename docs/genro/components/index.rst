introduction
============

    A component is a python file that gathers some useful features (classes) that can be used in more
    than one project. Every component can be rewritten in most of its parts (methods) overriding them.
    This ensures the ability to customize a component for your specific purpose.
    
    Components belong to the family of Genro :ref:`intro_resources`.
