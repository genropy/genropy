    In this chapter we learn about how to make a print in a :ref:`project`.
    
    In GenroPy a print is handled as a *resource script* of the :ref:`tables <table>`.
    So, it can be easily personalized for every application.
    
    The prints can be handled through two files:
    
    * one file for the settings of the print (:ref:`print_settings`)
    * one file for the layout properties of the print (:ref:`print_layout`)
    
    There is also the possibility to create a letterhead in your print: to do this
    you can use the :ref:`htmltemplate`
    
    When you have created these two files, you have to create in a :ref:`webpages_webpages`
    a GUI that allows the user to start a print. If you use the :ref:`th`, this process
    is auto handled by the component. For more information on how to create a print in a
    webpage, check the :ref:`this section <print_settings_webpage>`.
