 Common attributes
===================

In this section we report all those attributes that are common to many Genro objects. Nevertheless, we report those attributes even in the single widget, suggesting to take vision of this page for more details.

**Index:**

	- datapath_

	- disabled_
	
	- label_
		
	- hidden_
		
	- value_

**Attributes:**

.. _datapath:

**datapath**:

	- Description: datapath is an attribute used to create a hierarchy of your data's addresses. You can give "datapath" attribute to each object (widget, etc), but it is useful give this attribute only to the objects that contain other objects (let's call them "containers").
	
	
	The datastore and the Javascript code of Genro
	==============================================

	Through various commands python, you can attach the javascript code to the events of the components interface or events generated by the datastore

	The datastore is a Genro bag.

	Syntax for datapath
	*******************

	The path followed by the syntax in the datastore:

	* ``path.absolute.in.datastore``
	* ``.path.relative.in.datastore``
	* ``#ID.path.relative.to.the.ID``

	The path indicates the access path to data to virtually every element of the datastore (it is implemented by reading the Bag interface, and thus includes many things: for example, you can also specify the CSS classes of an HTML element linking them to an element of the datastore), using the prefixes:

	* "^" (circumflex accent): ``^access.to.resolver``, setting an observer at this node. The component will be informed of changes to the datastore
	* equal: ``=accessed.from.resolver``, reads the contents of the datastore.
	
	Access to the datastore from javascript
	***************************************

	The possible operations on the datastore include:

	**SET**:
		sets a value and triggers any associated events (ie any observers or resolver connected by "^")
	**PUT**:
		sets a value, but does not trigger the events associated
	**GET**:
		reads the contents of a value in the datastore
	**FIRE**:
		sets a value in the datastore, and then triggers the events associated, and then resets the value to zero (without triggering events). It is used when you need to trigger events via a temporary parameter to the Observers.

	These operations can be specified in the javascript events associated with an interface, the framework deals gnrjs to the expansion of these macros. It 'can be accessed from its datastore javascript code (ie from code written in .JS file and then read without macro-expansion) using simple javascript functions.
	
	
	
	
	

	- Validity: it works on every objects.

	- Default value: None

		Example::

			pane.borderContainer(datapath='example')
			
			
			""" 

		    Let's see an example:
		        box = pane.div(datapath='father')   (this div is the father, and datapath carries an absolute path)
		        box.textbox(value='^.son')          (this textbox is the son)

		    If you want to create a son with an absolute path, you simply mustn't write the dot at the
		    beginning of son's datapath, like:
		        box.textbox(value='^.another_son',datapath='father_2') (this datapath will have an absolute path)

		    You can also create a datapath with a relative path; for doing this you have to put the dot at
		    the beginning of son's datapath, like:
		        box.textbox(value='^.another_son',datapath='.father_2') (this datapath will inherit from the previous datapath)

		    Pay attention to not create a relative path without an absolute path as father!"""

		    #   - attributes of datapath's sons:
		    #       value: set item's address.
		    #
		    #   - Other forms, attributes and items:
		    #       In this section we report forms/attributes that have been used in this example
		    #       despite they didn't strictly belonging to datapath.
		    #       We also suggest you the file (if it has been created!) where you can find
		    #       some documentation about them.
