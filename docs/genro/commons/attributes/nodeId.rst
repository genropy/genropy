Definition and description
==========================

    *nodeId* is an attribute used to give an ID to an object.
    
    Some object supports the *Code* attribute. For example, the :ref:`genro_framepane` has got the
    *frameCode* and :ref:`genro_toolbar` have got the slotbarCode.
    Through the *Code* attribute, the *nodeId* is automatically created in the object to which you
    give the code and in every child of this object.
    
    If the object you are using doesn't support the *Code* attribute, you have to define a *nodeId*
    for him and a different *nodeId* for every of its children.
