introduction
============
    
    * In this section we report all those attributes that are common to many Genro
      :ref:`webpage_elements_index` and to many :ref:`components`. At the beginning
      of every page you can find a note that explains on which type you can use the
      relative attribute
      
    * You can use every CSS attribute on any Genro :ref:`webpage element
      <webpage_elements_index>` and on every :ref:`component <components>`. For more
      information, check the :ref:`introduction to CSS <css>` and in particular the
      :ref:`css_names` section, that includes all those CSS attributes that have a
      different name in Genro
