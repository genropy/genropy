    In this section we describe all the attributes and metadata that are common to many
    objects.
    
    You can find the following tipologies:
    
    * the :ref:`common_index`: these attributes can be used on the
      :ref:`webpage elements <webpage_elements_index>`
    * the :ref:`datatypes <datatype>` (``dtypes``): they are used to define the typology
      of the :ref:`columns <table_column>` in a database :ref:`project` management
    * the :ref:`commons_names`: these are the metadata through which you visualize records
      in a database :ref:`project` management
