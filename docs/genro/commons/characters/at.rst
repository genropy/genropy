    You can build :ref:`relations <relation>` to create links between database tables.
    
    Once you created a relation, you can use the :ref:`relation_path` or the :ref:`inv_rel_path`
    to use data of a table in another related table.
    
    The ``@`` character is the character used in Genro to start a *relation path* or an *inverse
    relation path*.
