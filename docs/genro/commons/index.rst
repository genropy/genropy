    * the :ref:`attributes_index`: they can be used on many :ref:`webpage_elements_index`
    * the :ref:`datatypes <datatype>` (``dtypes``): they are used to define the typology
      of the :ref:`columns <table_column>` in a database :ref:`project` management
    * the :ref:`macro`: they are javascript shortcuts to perform callbacks
    * the :ref:`commons_names`: they are the metadata through which you visualize records
