    In this file you can modify the ``instanceconfig.xml`` of the specified
    :ref:`genro_project` you're workin' on.
    
    So, if you do some changements in this file, they will affect only the single
    project in which this file is defined.
    
    If you want to make global changements (that are changements that belong
    to each of your projects), you have to modify the :ref:`genro_gnr_instanceconfig`
    file of the :ref:`genro_gnr_index` folder.
    
    However, the complete description of the ``instanceconfig.xml`` file lies in the global
    :ref:`genro_gnr_instanceconfig` file documentation page. Check it for more information.
