``sites`` folder content list
=============================

    If you follow the steps of the :ref:`project_autocreation` section, inside your
    ``sites`` folder you will find a ``site`` folder including ``pages`` folder, a
    ``root`` file and a ``siteconfig`` file.
    
    Click on the following links for information about them:
    
    * :ref:`sites_pages`

.. _sites_autofill:

autocreation of the ``sites`` folder
====================================

    You can create a ``sites`` folder typing::
    
        gnrmksite sitesName
        
    where ``sitesName`` is the name of your ``sites`` folder (that we suggest you to call
    as your :ref:`project` folder).
    
    Your ``sites`` folder will look like this one:
