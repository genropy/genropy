introduction
============

    The ``sites`` folder:
    
    * deals with everything related to the configuration of a particular installation
    * includes Web components and configurations that are necessary for the execution over
      the Web
    * typically contains the configuration and WSGI script in the :ref:`sites_root` (it is
      used as the executable if you want to use a debugger, like WingIDE_)
