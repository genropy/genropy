    In the ``webpages`` folder you can keep all your :ref:`webpages_webpages`.
    
    In Genropy, a webpage is written as a Python file.
    
    In addition to the webpages that you can create, there are some *standard*
    webpages, that are:
    
    * the :ref:`webpages_index` page.
    * the :ref:`webpages_login` page.
