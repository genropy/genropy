.. _genro_webpage_resources:

==============
``_resources``
==============

    In the ``_resources`` folder you can put every *private* resource for your
    :ref:`genro_project` (follow the relative links for more information about them):
    
    * javascript files
    * :ref:`genro_css`
    * :ref:`genro_components_index`
    
    For *private* we mean that you can use these resources only in the package in which they are
    defined. If you want to use them in other projects, you can define them in the
    :ref:`genro_resources_index` folder:
    
    .. image:: ../../../../images/structure/structure-resources.png
    
    .. note::
    
             * Remember that the "``_resources``" and the "``resources``" folder are the only place
               in which Genro will search your resources.
             * For more information, please check the :ref:`genro_resources_index` documentation page
