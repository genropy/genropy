``resources`` - (private)
=========================

    .. note:: In this section we will talk about the :ref:`genro_private_resource`\s of your
              project. For the introduction to the concept of resource, please check the
              :ref:`genro_resources_index` documentation page.
    
    In this folder you can keep the :ref:`genro_private_resource`\s of your
    :ref:`genro_project`; in particular you can:
    
    * add an action (batches)
    * add a print
    * add a folder for your images, doc...
    * add your :ref:`genro_css` files
    
    SISTEMARE QUI!!! add???
    
    In the ``_resources`` folder you can put every *private* resource for your
    :ref:`genro_project` (follow the relative links for more information about them):
    
    * javascript files
    * :ref:`genro_css`
    * :ref:`genro_components_index`
    
    For *private* we mean that you can use these resources only in the package in which they are
    defined. If you want to use them in other projects, you can define them in the
    :ref:`genro_resources_index` folder:
    
    .. note::
    
             * Remember that the add???"``_resources``" and the "``resources``" folder are the
               only place in which Genro will search your resources.
             * For more information, please check the :ref:`packages_resources` documentation page
