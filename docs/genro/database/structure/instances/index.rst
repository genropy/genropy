	The ``instances`` folder is... DEFINITION ???

.. _instances_autofill:

autocreation of the ``instance`` folder
=======================================

	You can create an ``instances`` folder typing::
	
		gnrmkinstance instancename -i
	
	where ``instancename`` is the name of your instance (we suggest you to call your instance with the same name of your :ref:`genro_structure_mainproject`).
	
	Your ``instances`` folder will look like this one:
	
	.. image:: ../../../images/structure/structure-instances.png

.. _instances_map:

``instance`` folder content list
================================

	Inside every instance folder you will find a ``custom`` folder, a ``data`` folder and the ``instanceconfig`` file.
