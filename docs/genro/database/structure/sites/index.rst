.. _sites_autofill:

autocreation of the ``sites`` folder
=======================================

	You can create a ``sites`` folder typing::
	
		gnrmksite sitesname
	
	where ``sitesname`` is the name of your ``sites`` folder (that we suggest you to call as your :ref:`genro_structure_mainproject` folder).
		
	Your ``sites`` folder will look like this one:
	
	.. image:: ../../../images/structure/structure-sites.png
	
.. _sites_map:

``instance`` folder content list
================================

	Inside every instance folder you will find a ``custom`` folder, a ``data`` folder and the ``instanceconfig`` file.
