.. _genro_webpage_resources:

==============
``_resources``
==============

    In the ``_resources`` folder you can put every *private* resource for your :ref:`genro_structure_mainproject`
    (follow the relative links for more information about them):
    
    * javascript files
    * :ref:`genro_css`
    * :ref:`genro_components_index`
    
    For *private* we mean that you can use these resources only in this project. If you want to use them in other projects,
    you can define them in the :ref:`genro_resources_index` folder:
    
    .. image:: ../../../../../images/structure/structure-resources.png
    
    .. note::
    
             * Remember that the "``_resources``" and the "``resources``" folder are the only place
               in which Genro will search your javascript files, css elements and components.
             * For more information on how insert your resources in the webpages, please check the
               following section: :ref:`webpages_js_requires`, :ref:`webpages_css_requires`,
