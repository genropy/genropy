 Introduction to widget elements
=================================

	.. note:: We recommend you to read the :ref:`genro_datapath` paragraph before reading this section, because every widget is able to save its values through the ``datapath`` and ``value`` attributes.

	Genro uses Dojo widget elements. They allow you to create the layout of the webpage and allow you to introduce the input elements (like a button, a checkbox, etc).
	
	Most of the Genro widget syntax inherit from the Dojo syntax; however, you can check the relative documentation of a widget for a complete reference of our language.
	
	The widget elements are divided in two categories, that are:
	
		* The :ref:`genro-form-index`
		* The :ref:`genro-layout-index`
