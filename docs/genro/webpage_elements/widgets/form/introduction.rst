Introduction to the form widgets
================================

    In Genro you can use the form widgets. But what is a form widget? Dojo defines them in this way:
    *It roughly means a widget that appear inside a form, but technically we think of it as
    “anything that has a value”.*
    
    As we previously said [#]_, Genro inherits some of its form widgets directly from Dojo (:ref:`dojo_form_widgets`)
    
    There are also some form widgets that have been taken from Dojo adding some features.
    (:ref:`dojo_improved_form_widgets`)
    
    Finally, there are some widgets built directly through the Genro framework
    (:ref:`genro_form_widgets`)
