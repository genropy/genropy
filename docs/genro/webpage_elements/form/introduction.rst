Introduction
============

    A form on a webpage allows the users to enter data that are sent to a server for processing.
    
    Let's see an example of form:
    
    .. image:: ../../images/form.png
    
    In genro you can handle easy the creation of a form through the :ref:`genro_formbuilder`.
    
    The formbuilder uses:
    
    * :ref:`genro_form_widgets_index` for users interactions
    * (optional) :ref:`genro_validations` to check the correct form of these insertions.
