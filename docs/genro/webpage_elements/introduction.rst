    .. note:: We recommend you to read the :ref:`datapath` paragraph before reading this section
              and learn the behavior of *datapath* and *value* attributes, because every webpage element
              is able to save its values through these two attributes.
    
    You can act on a Genro :ref:`webpages_webpages` mainly through:
    
    * :ref:`layout_index` elements - allow to create the webpage's layout
    * :ref:`html`
    * :ref:`css` elements
    * :ref:`javascript` elements
    * :ref:`form_widgets_index` - The primary UI
    * :ref:`forms <form>` - the standard way to let the user enter data
    * :ref:`datacontroller_index` - receive input and initiate a response by making calls on model objects
