    .. note:: We recommend you to read the :ref:`genro_datapath` paragraph before reading this section and learn the
              behavior of *datapath* and *value* attributes, because every webpage element is able to save its values
              through these two attributes.
    
    You can act on a Genro :ref:`webpages_webpages` through:
    
    * :ref:`genro_layout_index` - they allow to create the webpage's layout of your webpages
