    .. note:: We recommend you to read the :ref:`genro_datapath` paragraph before reading this section and learn the
              behavior of *datapath* and *value* attributes, because every webpage element is able to save its values
              through these two attributes.
    
    You can act on a Genro :ref:`webpages_webpages` mainly through:
    
    * :ref:`genro_layout_index` - they allow to create the webpage's layout of your webpages
    * :ref:`genro_html` - standard HTML elements
    * :ref:`genro_css` - standard CSS elements
    * :ref:`genro_form_widgets_index` - The primary UI
    * :ref:`genro_form_index`\s - the standard way to let the user enter data that are sent to a server for processing
    * :ref:`genro_data` *elements* - Used to define variables from server to client
    * :ref:`genro_dataremote` *elements* - Synchronous rpc
    * :ref:`genro_datacontroller_index` - They receive input and initiate a response by making calls on model objects
