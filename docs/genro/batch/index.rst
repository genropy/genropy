introduction
============

    In this chapter we learn about batches.
    
    A batch is ... add???
    
    In Genropy you can use a batch to:
    
    * perform an :ref:`action`
    * send :ref:`emails <mail>`
    * create a :ref:`print`
    
    The base class of every batch is the :class:`BaseResourceBatch
    <gnr.web.batch.btcbase.BaseResourceBatch>` class (check the link for the complete
    methods reference)
    
    Check also the :ref:`btcbase_webpage_variables`, that belong to every batch
    (:ref:`action`, :ref:`mail` and :ref:`print`)
