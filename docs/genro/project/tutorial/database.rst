    .. warning:: every Genro package has got a corresponding sql schema. We suggest you to
                 call both the package and the schema with the **same name** - this simplifies
                 your work. Otherwise, if you keep different names for the package and for the
                 schema, remember that when you make an sql query - on any other sql operation
                 - you have to refer the query to the schema name, while when you operate on
                 the package, you have to call it with the package name
