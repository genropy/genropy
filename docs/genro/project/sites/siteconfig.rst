    In this file you can modify the ``sitesconfig.xml`` of the specified :ref:`project`
    you're workin' on.
    
    So, if you do some changements in this file, they will affect only the single project in
    which this file is defined.
    
    If you want to make global changements (that are changements that belong to each of your projects),
    you have to modify the :ref:`gnr_siteconfig` file of the :ref:`gnr_index` folder.
    
    However, the complete description of the ``sitesconfig.xml`` file lies in the global
    :ref:`gnr_siteconfig` file page. Check it for more information.
