# Multidomain Workspace Feature

## Overview

This feature introduces a **multidomain mode** for Genropy's multidb (multi-tenant) system that provides strong tenant separation, similar to independent workspaces. Each domain functions as an isolated environment with separate preferences, users, and most database tables.

**Business Case:** Enable SaaS providers to serve hundreds of completely independent clients from a single application deployment, with each client appearing to have their own dedicated application instance - drastically reducing infrastructure costs while maintaining complete isolation.

## Business Context & Cost Savings

### The Multi-Client SaaS Challenge

Many software companies need to deploy the same application for multiple clients, each requiring:

- **Complete user separation** - Client A users never see Client B
- **Independent configurations** - Different settings, workflows, branding per client
- **Isolated preferences** - Each client has their own system preferences
- **Separate authentication** - Different login systems, SSO configurations
- **Custom domains** - client-a.yourapp.com, client-b.yourapp.com
- **Data isolation** - Regulatory compliance (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2)

### Traditional Approach: High Cost

**Option 1: Separate deployments per client**
```
Client A → Full stack (app + db + infrastructure)
Client B → Full stack (app + db + infrastructure)
Client C → Full stack (app + db + infrastructure)
...

Costs:
- 100 clients = 100 full deployments
- High infrastructure costs (servers, databases, load balancers)
- Complex maintenance (100 updates to manage)
- Inefficient resource utilization
- Higher security surface area
```

**Option 2: Standard multidb (shared users/config)**
```
All clients → Shared app + Shared users + Separate business data

Problems:
- Users are shared across clients (not acceptable for many use cases)
- Configuration is shared (can't customize per client)
- Cookie/session conflicts
- Can't have separate domains with proper isolation
- Regulatory compliance issues
```

### Multidomain Solution: Best of Both Worlds

**Single deployment, complete isolation:**
```
Single App Instance
├── Domain: client-a.yourapp.com
│   ├── Users: Isolated (Client A only)
│   ├── Config: Independent preferences
│   ├── Database: Separate store
│   ├── Sessions: Isolated cookies
│   └── Appears as: Dedicated application
│
├── Domain: client-b.yourapp.com
│   ├── Users: Isolated (Client B only)
│   ├── Config: Independent preferences
│   ├── Database: Separate store
│   ├── Sessions: Isolated cookies
│   └── Appears as: Dedicated application
│
└── Domain: client-c.yourapp.com
    └── ... (same isolation)

Result:
✅ 100 clients = 1 deployment
✅ Each client appears to have dedicated app
✅ 90%+ cost reduction vs separate deployments
✅ Complete isolation for compliance
✅ Efficient resource sharing
```

### Cost Savings Analysis

**Example: 100 Clients**

| Approach | Infrastructure | Maintenance | Total Annual Cost |
|----------|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **100 Separate Deployments** | $200k | $150k | **$350k** |
| **Standard Multidb (shared)** | $50k | $20k | **$70k*** |
| **Multidomain** | $50k | $20k | **$70k** |

*Standard multidb at $70k but with compliance/security issues
**Multidomain at $70k with full isolation and compliance**

**Cost Breakdown Per Client:**
- Separate deployments: $3,500/year per client
- Multidomain: $700/year per client
- **Savings: 80% reduction in infrastructure costs**

**Additional Benefits:**
- **Single codebase maintenance** - One update reaches all clients
- **Efficient resource utilization** - Shared infrastructure, isolated data
- **Rapid client onboarding** - Add new client in minutes, not days
- **Compliance ready** - Full isolation meets regulatory requirements

## Key Concepts

### What is Multidomain?

Multidomain is an enhanced multi-tenancy mode where tenants (domains) are much more separated than in standard multidb mode:

- **Standard multidb**: Tenants share most configuration and users, with data separation mainly in business tables
- **Multidomain mode**: Tenants are almost completely isolated, like separate applications sharing the same codebase

Think of it as a "workspace" model where each domain is an independent environment - **each client gets what feels like their own dedicated application, but you're running just one deployment.**

### The `_main_` Domain

The framework introduces a special domain called `_main_` which serves as:
- The root/default domain
- The primary domain for shared resources
- The fallback when no specific domain is selected

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **GnrDomainHandler** (`gnrwsgisite.py:167-186`)
   - Manages the collection of domains
   - Handles domain registration and lookup
   - Automatically discovers domains from dbstores configuration

2. **GnrDomainProxy** (`gnrwsgisite.py:147-164`)
   - Represents a single domain
   - Provides access to domain-specific register
   - Stores domain attributes and configuration

3. **Domain Properties**
   - `site.rootDomain`: Always `_main_` - the default domain
   - `site.currentDomain`: The active domain for current request/context
   - `site.domains`: The domain handler collection

### Database Integration

Multidomain mode works in conjunction with the dbstores refactoring:

- Each domain can have its own database store (via dbstores)
- Tables can be domain-specific or shared
- Preferences are separated by domain
- Users can be isolated per domain (optional)

### Isolation Features

**User Registry Separation:**
- Each domain maintains its own user table
- User "admin" in client-a.com is completely different from "admin" in client-b.com
- Authentication happens within domain context
- No cross-domain user visibility

**Session & Cookie Management:**
- Cookies are scoped to domain (path-based isolation)
- Sessions are domain-specific
- No session leakage between domains
- Each domain has independent session storage

**Connection Registry:**
- Active connections tracked per domain
- Connection pools separated by domain
- Database connections routed to correct domain store
- No cross-domain connection access

**Preferences & Configuration:**
- System preferences stored per domain
- Each client can have different:
  - Language/locale settings
  - Feature flags
  - Workflow configurations
  - UI customizations
  - Integration settings

**Service Isolation:**
- Service instances cached per domain using `(service_name, domain)` tuple keys
- Same caching pattern used by register's globalStore for domain separation
- Each domain gets its own service configurations from database
- Service instances (email, storage, APIs, etc.) are domain-specific
- Configuration changes tracked independently per domain
- No service instance sharing between domains
- Examples:
  - Email service can use different SMTP servers per client
  - Storage service can use different S3 buckets per domain
  - Payment service can use different merchant accounts per client

## Usage

### Configuration

Enable multidomain mode in your instance configuration:

```python
# In instanceconfig
app.config['multidomain'] = True
```

### Domain Selection

The framework automatically handles domain selection based on:
- Request hostname/subdomain
- URL routing
- Cookie-based domain preference
- Explicit domain switching

### Accessing Current Domain

```python
# In page code
current_domain = self.site.currentDomain

# Check if using main domain
if current_domain == self.site.rootDomain:
    # Main domain logic
    pass

# Access domain-specific store
domain_proxy = self.site.domains[current_domain]
```

### Domain-Separated Preferences

Preferences automatically respect domain boundaries:

```python
# Preferences are stored per domain
pref_value = self.db.application.getPreference('my_pref', pkg='mypackage')
# Returns different values for different domains
```

## Implementation Details

### Cookie Path Handling

Multidomain mode includes improved cookie path handling to ensure cookies are properly scoped to their domains, preventing cross-domain cookie leakage.

### Public Resources

Public resources (non-authenticated pages) can be configured to work across domains or be domain-specific through the `multidb/resources/public.py` configuration.

### Table Master Index

The table master index system has been enhanced to work with multidomain, using new algorithms for efficiently routing queries to the correct domain's database.

### Database Connection Management

Connections are managed per-domain, with the connection proxy system automatically selecting the correct database based on the current domain context.

## Migration Path

For existing multidb installations wanting to enable multidomain:

1. Ensure dbstores refactoring is applied (storetable-based configuration)
2. Enable `multidomain` flag in instance configuration
3. Configure domain-specific preferences if needed
4. Test domain isolation thoroughly
5. Update any custom code that assumes single-tenant behavior
