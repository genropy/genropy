# Branch Separation - Completion Report

## Summary

Successfully separated the `feature/remove-dbstores-config` branch into two independent feature branches:

2. **feature/multidomain-workspace** - Multidomain workspace feature

---

## Branch Details

### 1. feature/refactor-dbstores-storetable

**Base:** `develop`
**Status:** ✅ Complete with 8 cherry-picked commits
**Purpose:** Database-based store configuration (storetable)

**Commits included:**
```
17a03d20a - dbstores handler changes (Sept 9, 2025)
611f40e5f - auxdbstores in instance (Sept 10, 2025)
66870c9e4 - Improves cache and store handling; adds union dict (Sept 10, 2025)
a88c851ba - Refactors DB adapter to use unified raw_fetch API (Sept 10, 2025)
b7a866fc9 - Refactors storetable handling for multidb package (Sept 15, 2025)
50b19d812 - Improves dbstore activation logic and selector access (Sept 15, 2025)
936dce6f3 - Improves multi-db store activation and migration sync (Sept 16, 2025)
3826a5d2f - pref handler multidb_pref (Sept 16, 2025)
```

**Note:** Commit `9b0d2c011` (storetable - Sept 25) was skipped as it contained only multidomain-related changes.

**Conflicts resolved:**
- `gnrsql.py` - Merged `get_connection_params()` keeping auxstores + error handling + dbbranch support
- `gnrapp.py` - Added `storetable` property
- `gnrsqlmigration.py` - Merged imports

**Key changes:**
- Database-based store configuration via storetable
- Support for auxstores
- Improved error handling for missing stores
- Connection parameter fallback mechanism
- UnionDict utility for configuration merging

---

### 2. feature/multidomain-workspace

**Base:** `feature/remove-dbstores-config` + `develop` merged
**Status:** ✅ Complete with all code and documentation
**Purpose:** Strong tenant separation (workspace mode)

**Contains:**
- All dbstores refactoring code (as base)
- Complete multidomain implementation
- Domain handler infrastructure
- Domain-separated preferences
- Cookie path handling for domains
- Public resource configuration

**Cleanup performed:**
- Removed unused `gnrdaemonhandler_multidomain.py` (399 lines of dead code)
- Merged latest changes from develop

**Dependencies:**
- Requires `feature/refactor-dbstores-storetable` to be merged to develop first
- After dbstores merge, needs rebase on updated develop

## Technical Decisions

### Conflict Resolution Strategy

1. **gnrsql.py `get_connection_params()`**
   - Chose feature branch version (cleaner logic with auxstores)
   - Added `dbbranch` parameter from develop
   - Kept error handling and fallback mechanism
   - Result: Best of both versions

2. **gnrapp.py `storetable` property**
   - Kept the property (part of dbstores refactoring)

3. **gnrsqlmigration.py imports**
   - Merged both import additions

4. **storetable.py `multidb_activateDbstore()`**
   - Excluded all multidomain-specific logic
   - Kept simple dbstores-only implementation
   - Multidomain enhancements stay in multidomain branch

### Code Separation Principles

**DBStores branch contains:**
- Core store configuration mechanism
- Database connection management
- Store activation/deactivation
- Migration and sync utilities
- No domain-specific logic

**Multidomain branch contains:**
- Domain handler (GnrDomainHandler, GnrDomainProxy)
- Domain context management
- Domain-separated preferences
- Cookie and session handling per domain
- Domain-aware database routing
- Full dbstores functionality (as dependency)

## Lessons Learned

1. **Cherry-picking across evolved branches requires careful conflict resolution**
   - Develop had evolved independently
   - Some features (dbbranch) were added separately
   - Solution: Merge intelligently, keeping best of both versions

2. **Separation by feature works best when features are orthogonal**
   - DBStores = configuration mechanism (infrastructure)
   - Multidomain = tenant isolation (feature)
   - Clear separation made cherry-picking decisions easier

3. **Documentation is crucial for understanding dependencies**
   - Clear docs help identify what belongs where
   - Tickets clarify acceptance criteria
   - Setup notes prevent mistakes during integration

4. **Some commits can become empty after conflict resolution**
   - Commit 9b0d2c011 was all multidomain code
   - Correctly skipped for dbstores branch
   - Will naturally be included in multidomain branch

## Repository State

**Current branches:**
```
develop                              (base branch)
feature/remove-dbstores-config       (original mixed branch - can be deleted)
feature/refactor-dbstores-storetable (dbstores only - ready for PR)
feature/multidomain-workspace        (multidomain + dbstores - ready after dbstores merge)
```

**Recommended cleanup after merges:**
```bash
# After dbstores merged to develop and multidomain rebased
git branch -d feature/remove-dbstores-config

# After multidomain merged to develop
# All features complete
```

---

## Success Criteria Met

- ✅ Two separate feature branches created
- ✅ DBStores branch contains only infrastructure changes
- ✅ Multidomain branch contains only feature changes (+ dependency on dbstores)
- ✅ All conflicts resolved intelligently
- ✅ Dead code removed
- ✅ Comprehensive English documentation created
- ✅ No Claude co-authorship in commits
- ✅ Clear testing and deployment path defined
- ✅ Dependencies clearly documented
