Version 25.04.10
================

Overview
--------

This release delivers major improvements across the database migration
tooling, PostgreSQL adapter, Docker tooling, UI components (especially
attachment and media handling), and the web server infrastructure. It
also introduces a WSGI testing framework, endpoint handling for
tables, fixes to ensure compatibility with various Python versions.

Enhancements
------------

* **General Code Improvements**:
  * Introduced SQL comment decorators for better traceability in SQL execution.
  * Standardized decorator patterns across the codebase for clarity.
  * `_documentation` storage is now used for **locally generated** documentation files, improving file management.
  * **Removed `httplib2`**, replacing it with `requests`, which is more actively maintained. 
  * **Removed `future` dependency**, since Python 3 is now the baseline. 
  * Eliminated **redundant** runtime imports to **reduce startup overhead**.
  * Removed **`simplejson`**, since `json` is part of Pythonâ€™s standard library.
  - Removed **unused imports** across multiple files.
    
* **SQL Improvements**:
  * Enhanced database migration logic by improving error handling for relation-based exceptions.
  * The `GNR_GLOBAL_DEBUG` flag was removed, and `gnr db migrate` now defaults to **INFO** log level instead of DEBUG.
  * Improved `checkRelationIndex()` to log more descriptive errors when an invalid relation is encountered.
  * Improved handling of deferred relations and indexing for tenant schemas.
  * **New `#BETWEEN` syntax** added for SQL queries, supporting range
    filtering (e.g., dates, integers), which include the **upper
    bound** by default.
  * Excluded unique constraints that overlap with primary keys.
  * Added support for PostgreSQL extensions in migrations, including:
    * Commands to create extensions.
    * Integration with the migration framework.
  * Added event triggers to the migration structure.
  * **New `--inspect` flag for `gnr db migrate`**. Outputs a zip file
    with SQL schema, DB structure in JSON, ORM state, and planned SQL
    changes.
  * Added support to avoid table creation if columns are empty.
  * Centralized UNIQUE constraint generation (`addColumnUniqueConstraint()` method).
  * Improved diff and handler mechanism with default fallback for missing handlers.
  * New test cases covering unique columns and empty tables.

* **PostgreSQL Utilities**:
  * Introduced new utilities for monitoring PostgreSQL performance:
    * Queries for most-used indexes and sequential scans.
    * Autovacuum status monitoring.
    * Top and least-efficient queries statistics.

* **Database Schema**:
  * Added support for extension management in migration commands.
  * Introduced structured column grouping (`colgroup_label`, `colgroup_name_long`) for better schema organization.
  * Refactored column width estimation logic to use **a lookup table** for improved accuracy.
  * Enhanced column width calculations when handling **empty tables**. 
  * Injected column group metadata into table models to improve **attribute management**. 

* **Database adapters**:
  * Updated PostgreSQL adapter to handle `DEFERRABLE` and `INITIALLY DEFERRED` constraints.
  * Added support for capabilities declaration inside of database
    adapter, in order to conditionally execute specific tasks base on such
    specific capabilities.
  * Introduced 'postgres3' database adapter which uses the psycopg3 driver.
  * Aligned adapters inheritance method and added test coverage for it
  * Improved FK detection with ordering preserved.
  * Extended constraint introspection logic for better diff generation.
  * Multikey sort support for foreign keys.
  * Ordered foreign key extraction for better reproducibility.
  - The `gnr db migrate` command recognizes adapter-specific
    capabilities, ensuring better database compatibility.

* **Logging infrastructure**:
  * Introduced a consistent usage of python logging inside the framework.
  * All CLI commands provide a `--loglevel` options to set the logging level.
  * Logging levels can be also defined using `GNR_LOGLEVEL` env var.
  * `sys` package provide a minimale UI to control levels for each
    package of the framework.
  * Logging captures **all** exceptions for model relation validation errors.
    
* Added 'gnr dev bugreport <instance name>' to create a report of
  the current environment the instance is using, for more complete
  bug reports - please see `--help` for possible usage

* **Sphinx Export Enhancements**
  * Improved **error handling** when exporting documentation to **Sphinx**.
  * Missing images will **no longer break** the export process. 
  * Removed redundant configuration settings for **handbook preferences**. 
  * Instead of spawning an **external** Sphinx process, the framework now calls the **Sphinx build API directly**.

* **AttachManager Enhancements**:
  - Supports inline preview for images with zoom-in feature.
  - Conditional PDF viewer usage based on file extension.
  - Reworked iframe viewer logic for better handling of images/videos/docs.

* **Login Reload Fix**:
  * Removed `gnrtoken` from reload URLs to avoid state duplication.

- **PDF/Image Preview Detection Logic**:
  - Refined JS detection of when to use PDF viewer vs inline display.

- **GnrWsgiSite refactoring**:
  - Safer fallback on bad URLs or missing packages.
  - Better modularity in `UrlInfo` routing logic.
  - Handles edge cases like `..//etc/passwd` to harden path traversal.

- **Werkzeug Compatibility Patch**:
  - Fix for subcommand CLI trick used by `gnr` that breaks Python 3.8 autoreloader.

Docker Tooling
--------------

* Introducing a new docker image creation, based on the instance configuration
* Image creation and pushing towards registry
* Images are labeled with the details of all packages/repositoty involved.

Test Infrastructure
-------------------

* Added a **minimal `instanceconfig.xml`** with **framework-only packages** for unit testing.

* Eliminated runtime import artifacts and unused decorators.
* Removed deprecated mobile meta attributes.
* Corrected unique removal syntax from test fixtures.
* **MDEditor Focus Issue**
  * Fixed an issue where **MDEditor** would **lose focus**, leading to unsaved changes.

* **SQL Query Fixes**
  * Fixed incorrect **column width calculations** in `ThResourceMaker`. :contentReference[oaicite:33]{index=33}
  * Ensured `#BETWEEN` syntax correctly handles **blank values**. :contentReference[oaicite:34]{index=34}
  * SQL **range comparisons** now consistently include the **upper bound**. :contentReference[oaicite:35]{index=35}
